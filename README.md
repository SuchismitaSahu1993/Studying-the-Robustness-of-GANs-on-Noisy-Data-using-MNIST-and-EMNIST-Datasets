# Studying-the-Robustness-of-GANs-on-Noisy-Data-using-MNIST-and-EMNIST-Datasets

## Introduction
Generative Adversarial Networks are a class of generative models that can generate new content. GANs have been really successful in many current applications including generating synthetic datases for research, neural style transfer, image de-noising etc. GANs aim to learn the underlying distribution of the training data. The Generator and Discriminator are trained in such a way that the generator leans to create data such that the discriminator isn't able to distinguish as fake anymore.
